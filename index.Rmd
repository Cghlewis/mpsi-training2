* Data Collection Instrument Design

--

* Maintaining Data Security in the Field

--

* Creating a Tracking Database

* Data Storage and Security

--

* A Glimpse into File Structure

# The Institutional Review Board (IRB)

* A formal organization designated to review and monitor human participant research

* Ensures that the welfare, rights, and privacy of research participants are maintained throughout the project

* All data collection materials will be vetted by the IRB

* Always submit your materials to the IRB before collecting data

# Consent form

* Work with your data manager and your IRB to write a consent using language that allows for future data sharing

  + Don't promise to destroy your data (unless your funder explicitly requires it)  
  
  + Don't promise to not share data  
  
  + Do get consent to retain and share data  
  
  + Do incorporate data-retention and sharing clauses into IRB templates  
  
  + Do be thoughtful when considering risks of re-identification (ex: small sample size for sub-groups)

# Consent form language

* Compared to consent forms of the past, if you plan to share your data, language needs to be added to several **sections** of your consent

Starting with the **Purpose of the Study**:

```{r fig.align="center", echo=FALSE, out.width='80%'}
